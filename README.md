## Method

False Creek is an urban inlet that runs through the city of Vancouver British Columbia. From April to September 2022, the Hakai Institute and the False Creek Friends Society, in collaboration with the City of Vancouver and other local organizations, conducted a BioBlitz of False Creek. This initiative undertook community engagement activities (outreach, education and community science) and scientific initiatives to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biodiversity of the seafloor, the water and the shorelines of the False Creek area in Vancouver. The False Creek Bioblitz combined several complementary methods for studying biodiversity including visual observations, video surveys, DNA Barcoding, and the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to catalogue the biodiversity of False Creek. This metadata package provides links to the biodiversity and oceanographic data collected during these surveys.

## Reports

1. A scientific publication is currently being prepared based on results from the eDNA survey.

2. A technical report is currently being prepared based on the visual observation and occurence data.

Both of these reports will be added to this repository upon completion.

## Resources

The following data files are included in this repository:

1. FalseCreek_eDNA_Sample_Metadata_Sept19,2022.csv - Metadata for all seawater samples collected during the eDNA survey
2. False_Creek_Bioblitz_Oceanography_Dec06,2023.csv - Oceanography data collected during the eDNA survey
3. False_Creek_Bioblitz_Species_List_June2024.csv - A species list of all organisms that were visually observed during the False Creek Bioblitz

All raw Illumina sequence data have been deposited in NCBI (BioProject ID: PRJNA1049344): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/1049344
